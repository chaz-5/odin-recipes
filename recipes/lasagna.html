        <h3 class="lasagna-subs">Description</h3>
        <p id="lasagna-desc">Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
        <h3 class="lasagna-subs">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul id="ingred-list">
            <li>2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
            <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
            <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
            <li>a little grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>300g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>white sauce</li>
            <li>125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>

        </ul>
        <h3 class="lasagna-subs">Method</h3>
        <ol id="instruct-list">
            <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
            <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
            <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish.</li>
            <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you can't see any pasta poking through.</li>
            <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
            <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
