        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Use up your ripe bananas to make easy vegan banana bread - the perfect breakfast treat to enjoy with your morning cuppa. We love it toasted with peanut butter</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large black bananas</li>
            <li>75ml vegetable oil or sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
            <li>5100g brown sugar</li>
            <li>225g plain flour (or use self-raising flour and reduce the baking powder to 2 heaped tsp)</li>
            <li>3 heaped tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>3 tsp cinnamon or mixed spice</li>
            <li>50g dried fruit or nuts (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mash 3 large black peeled bananas with a fork, then mix well with 75g vegetable or sunflower oil and 100g brown sugar.</li>
                <li>Add 225g plain flour, 3 heaped tsp baking powder and 3 tsp cinnamon or mixed spice, and combine well. Add 50g dried fruit or nuts, if using.</li>
                <li>Bake in an oiled, lined 2lb loaf tin for 20 minutes. Check and cover with foil if the cake is browning.</li>
                <li>Bake for another 20 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Allow to cool a little before slicing. It's delicious freshly baked, but develops a lovely gooey quality the day after.</li>
        </ol>
