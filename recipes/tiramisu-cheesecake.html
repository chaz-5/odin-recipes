            <li>500g milk chocolate, the best quality you can find, finely chopped</li>
            <li>300ml double cream</li>

            <li>50g icing sugar</li>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment. Crush the biscuits as finely as possible in a food bag using a rolling pin, or in a food processor, and mix with the melted butter. Tip into the tin, pressing down to flatten and set aside in the fridge.</li>
                <li>For the chocolate layer, tip the chocolate, cream and Tia Maria into a bowl and melt over a pan of simmering water. Once melted, quickly stir together and pour over the biscuit base, then chill in the fridge for at least 3 hrs, or until set.</li>
                <li>When the chocolate layer is set, beat the cream cheese, double cream, vanilla, orange and sugar together, then spread and swirl the mix evenly over the chocolate layer. Put the cake back in the fridge for a couple of hours or overnight. Can be made up to two days in advance and kept covered in the fridge.</li>
                <li>To serve, remove from the fridge, sieve over the cocoa powder and sprinkle over the crushed coffee beans. Run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake and release from the tin and serve. For a neater finish, blowtorch the outside of the tin to release the sides.</li>
        </ol>
